\subsection{Performance of Stochastic Gradient Descent Training}

For the following experiments, we train our autoencoder over the MNIST handwritten digit
dataset. The MNIST dataset is composed of 60000 training images and 10000
testing images Each image is in greyscale, is 28 by 28 pixels in size, and has
a corresponding label ranging from 0 to 9. Thus, the input vector for our
autoencoder has 784 dimensions. We also make use of the denoising criterion
mentioned in \cite{vincent2010stacked}, and for each training image, randomly
corrupt it by setting each pixel to zero with probability 0.25.

	denoising autoencoder trained over all 60000 images.}
	\label{fig:experiment3_1}
\end{figure}



We first analyze how the number of threads affects the rate at which training
error decreases. We train a single autoencoder layer with 500 hidden nodes for
15 iterations over 5000 training images. An iteration involves going through
all training images and for each image, use SGD to update the weight matrix.
Fig.~\ref{fig:experiment1} shows the relationship between training error, total
time elapsed, and the number of threads used. Regardless of the number of
threads, the training error decreases sharply in the first few iterations
before flattening out to around the same value after 15 iterations. The rate at
which error decreases is significantly faster for four and eight threads when
compared to just using one. Nonetheless, the speedup is not linear and is due
to two reasons: 1) Possible cache conflicts as each thread read and writes to
different locations in the weight matrix. 2) All the steps for
backpropagation/SGD, described in Algorithm \ref{alg:backprop}, must be done
sequentially. Parallelization can only be done within each step and incurs an
overhead cost.

\subsection{Visualization of Autoencoder}

Next, in Fig.~\ref{fig:experiment3_1}, we visualize the filters that are
learned by training an autoencoder layer with 500 hidden nodes over all 60000
training images. The  filter for each hidden node is a row vector of the weight
matrix and indicates which aspects of the input the hidden unit is sensitive
to. Since each row in the weight matrix is the same dimensionality as the
input, we can visualize it as a 28 by 28 pixel image. The filters are not
identical to the input images, but do show some similarity to them. In
Fig.~\ref{fig:reconstruct}, we visualize the reconstructed digits when given
noisy test digits as input. The reconstructed outputs for most of the input
images are easily recognizable as digits, which indicates that the autoencoder
is indeed denoising and learning a good representation of the images.

To further demonstrate the reconstruction capabilities of the autoencoder, we
trained the autoencoder on corrupted or otherwise altered digits.  In
particular, we test the reconstruction on \textit{bg-rand}, which is generated
from the MNIST dataset, excpt that a random backgound is added. In
\textit{bg-img}, each image is given a background randomly selected from one of
twenty images downloaded form the internet. In \textit{rot}, the digits are
simply rotated by some random angle.  These alterations to the images make the
classification task more difficult. Indeed the digits are very difficult to
identify, but the autoencoder creates an easier to identify representation,
even to the human eye. We show also in Fig.~\ref{fig:reconstruct} the
reconstructed images form the \textit{bg-img} and \textit{rot} datasets. Note
that the images in the \textit{bg-rand} and \textit{bg-img} datasets are
rotated, but they are all rotated in the same way.



Finally we evaluate the classification accuracy of a deep neural network that
has multiple stacked denoising autoencoders. We train 3 stacked autoencoder
layers, each with 1000 hidden units, and using noise levels 0.1, 0.2, and 0.3
respectively. Each layer is trained for 15 iterations with a learning rate of
0.001. After the unsupervised pretraining, a conventional feedforward network
with 1000 input units, 500 hidden units and 10 outputs is connected to the
hidden units of the last autoencoder layer. This conventional network is then
trained for 30 iterations (learning rate 0.1) in a supervised manner, where the
target $t$ is the indicator vector representation of the training label. Our
final classification accuracy is 98.04\%. In comparison, the accuracy achieved
with a SVM with RBF kernel is 98.60\% \cite{vincent2010stacked}.

\subsection{Representation Learning for Supervised Classification}

Recall that one of the main reasons for using an autoencoder is to determine a
more useful representation of the data for other tasks, for example in a
classification task. To this end, we constructed and trained (15 iterations) an
autoencoder with just a single layer and 1000 hidden units and used it to
create a more useful representation of the digits in the MNIST dataset. After
this more useful representation is constructed, we can then use the output from
the autoencoder as input to another type of classification algorithm.  Since
the autoencoder produces a better representation of the data, we expect that
given the encoded data, the other classification algorithms should perform
better.  The results of these experiments is given in
Table.~\ref{tab:classvsenc}.

To test this,we used liblinear to attempt to train a model and then predict on
a test set for both the enocded and unencoded datasets. With the original data
liblinear gives an accuracy of 91.68\% on the test set when using the default
parameters. However, when the encoded data from the trained autoencoder gives
an accuracy of 97.07\%. This is a nontrivial improvement in the classification
accuracy. Thus, the autoencoder has created a better representation of the data
which maed it easier for liblinear to classify. This verifies that the
autoencoder is doing what it is expected to do.

Similarly, we performed the same experiment as above, except in this case we
used libsvm with an RBF kernel and all the default parameters.  Without
encoding the data first, we get an accuracy of 94.46\%, but using the encoded
data gives a prediction accuracy of 95.48\%. As above, the encoded data allows libsvm
better classify the data.

Using logistic regression to perform the classification, we experienced similar results.
Again we use liblinear with all default options except selecting logistic regression. Using the
original MNIST data, this algorithm achieved an accuracy of 91.82\% while with the encoded data
we achieved an accuracy of 96.86\%.

We performed the same experiments on the \textit{bg-rand}, \textit{bg-img} and 
\textit{rot} datasets as well. Across the board we see similar results. The encoding does not have much of
an effect on the ability of kernel SVM to classify the data, but for linear SVM and logistic regresssion, 
using the autoencoder always results in the classifier improving it's accuracy.

\subsection{Training the Autencoder with a Genetic Algorithm}

\begin{figure}[h] \centering
	\includegraphics[width=0.8\linewidth]{ga_comparison.png}
	\caption{Comparison of the performance of SGD, HGA, and CGA. SGD is fastest, while HGA achieves the lowest reconstruction error.}
	\label{fig:ga_comparison}
\end{figure}

In Fig.~\ref{fig:ga_comparison}, we compare the performance of stochastic gradient descent (SGD), our previously mentioned hybrid GA (HGA), which uses backpropagation to update the best individuals in the population, and a conventional GA (CGA), which does not use any gradient information. All three algorithms are used to train a single autoencoder layer with 1000 hidden units and cycle through 1000 training digits for 15 iterations. For SGD and HGA, we fix the learning rate to 0.0002. SGD is the fastest by roughly a factor of two when compared to HGA, while CGA is somewhere in between. However, HGA is able to achieve the lowest reconstruction error (8709 vs SGD's 9427). CGA performed the worst out of all 3 algorithms, having a reconstruction error that is three times larger than that of the other algorithms. The hyperparameters for HGA and CGA are hand tuned and not necessary optimal. However, we believe that will properly tuned hyperparameters, HGA might be competitive with SGD for both final reconstruction error and performance time. 

\begin{figure}[h] \centering
	\includegraphics[width=0.8\linewidth]{ga_comparison2.png}
	\caption{Comparison of the performance of SGD, HGA, and CGA. SGD is fastest, while HGA achieves the lowest reconstruction error.}
	\label{fig:ga_comparison2}
\end{figure}

Next in Fig.~\ref{fig:ga_comparison2}, we examine the scalability of HGA. HGA shows roughly 3x speedup when using 4 threads, 5x speedup when using 8 threads, and 6x speedup when using 16 threads. The performance improvement versus the number of threads is sublinear and can be attributed to two main causes: 1) Cache conflicts when performing mutation and crossover due to multiple threads writing and reading different memory locations, 2) The sequential nature of backpropagation, which HGA utilizes to help optimize the weights. However, we do see that HGA does seem to moderately better scalability than our parallel implementation of SGD. This is attributable to the fact that the mutation and crossover operators are very straightforward to parallelize and scale in performance very well.
