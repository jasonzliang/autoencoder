We have implemented stacked denoising autoencoders and shown that it achieves accuracy comparable to state of the art classifiers like a SVM with RBF kernel. We also shown that our autoencoder layers are learning good representations and are capable of denoising and reconstructing the input with little error. For future work, we plan on exploring other optimization algorithms such as genetic algorithms for training autoencoders. 

\begin{algorithm}[h]
\caption{Genetic Algorithm}
\label{alg:genetic}
\begin{algorithmic}
\STATE Initialize $N$ individuals randomly
\FOR{iter $=1,2,3...$}
	\STATE Evaluate each individual with objective function and assign fitness.
	\STATE Create $\alpha N$ ($0 < \alpha < 1$) new individuals by selecting good individuals from population and applying mutation and crossover operators to them.
	\STATE Replace worst $\alpha N$ individuals in population with newly created individuals.
\ENDFOR
\end{algorithmic}
